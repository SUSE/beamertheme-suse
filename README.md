# Why beamer?

* Office suites tend to be a pain for programmers
* It can be used from LaTeX, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

# Note

* This is a work in progress. Many styles do not comply yet with the branding guideline.
* This theme only works in 16:9

# Usage

You can install the theme system-wide in your Texlive distribution by installing [this package](http://software.opensuse.org/download/package?project=home:dmacvicar&package=texlive-beamertheme-suse).

As an alternative, put your slide next to [beamerthemesuse.sty](beamerthemesuse.sty) and the included assets.

If you install from the package, the Poppins and Roboto Mono fonts will be installed. Otherwise you will need to install them yourself:

```
$ zypper in google-poppins-fonts google-roboto-mono-fonts
```

See the LaTeX source of the included [example](example.tex) to get started.
